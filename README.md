🚀 Customer Churn Prediction with Support Vector Machines!

In this project, we dove into a telecom company's customer dataset 📊 and used Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict customer churn 👥💔.

We first preprocessed the data 🧹 by handling non-numeric values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Next, we trained our SVM model 🎓 and tested its performance on unseen data, achieving an accuracy of 82% 🎯.

Even though the model performed well overall, it showed better results for the not-churned class compared to the churned class, emphasizing the need for further tuning and experimentation 🧪.
